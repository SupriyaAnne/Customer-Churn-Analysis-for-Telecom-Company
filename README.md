# Tech Stack
**Python libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Jupyter Notebook:** Data analysis and visualization

**SQL (SQLite):** Querying and analysis

**Excel:** Quick pivot table KPIs and dashboarding

**Power BI:** Interactive dashboarding and business intelligence

# Key Analysis
Churn rate overall, by gender, region, and subscription plan

Monthly spend and tenure distributions for churned vs stayed customers

**Correlation analysis:** Features impacting churn (e.g., monthly spend, tenure, support tickets)

**Segmentation:** High-spend and long-tenure customers

**Interactive dashboards:** Churn breakdowns, KPIs, and filters

# Insights & Outcomes
**Churn Rate:** 25â€“30% of customers churned, highest in Premium plans and in the West region.

**Key Drivers:**

High-spending customers showed higher churn; even loyal, high-lifetime-value users left, highlighting dissatisfaction.

Lower tenure (new customers <12 months) were the most likely to churn.

More support tickets correlated with increased churn likelihood.

# Recommendations

Focus on early customer experience and onboarding.

Prioritize retention of premium and high-spending customers with targeted offers.

Improve support service quality.

Enhance digital payment method convenience.
